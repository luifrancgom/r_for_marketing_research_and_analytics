# Create the data ----

# Our hypothetical survey includes four questions about a 
# customerâ€™s satisfaction with different dimensions of a visit 
# to the amusement park: satisfaction with rides (rides), 
# games (games), waiting times (wait), and cleanliness (clean), 
# along with a rating of overall satisfaction (overall). In such 
# surveys, respondents often answer similarly on all satisfaction 
# questions; this is known as the halo effect.

# number of survey respondents
nresp <- 500 

# simulate a satisfaction halo with a random variable for each 
# customer
halo <- floor(rnorm(n=nresp, mean=0, sd=5))

# Satisfaction with rides, games, waiting times and cleanliness
rides <- floor(halo + rnorm(n=nresp, mean=80, sd=3)+7)
games <- floor(halo + rnorm(n=nresp, mean=70, sd=7)+10)
wait <- floor(halo + rnorm(n=nresp, mean=65, sd=10)+6)
clean <- floor(halo + rnorm(n=nresp, mean=85, sd=2)+4)

# By adding halo to the response for each question, we create 
# positive correlation between the responses. The constants 
# +1, +5, and +9 are arbitrary to adjust the ranges just for 
# appearance.
